      This is an ideal place for buying and selling. Sell Products without
      having a Store There is a marketplace that provides you an opportunity to
      sell you your products and services at a fair price, and you don’t have to
      worry about acquiring the online store and spend resources on establishing
      it. Already establish store would manage payment method, advertisement,
      logistics, and product details for you. Cheaper It’s much cheaper to sell
      your products at a marketplace than owning a store. You don’t have to pay
      costs like domain and hosting, SEO, copyrights, themes, web design, and
      other management costs. The marketplace would manage these costs and
      you’ll have a fully established store. Credibility and Trustworthy While
      starting an online store, it requires a lot of time to establish trust and
      credibility with your customers because people don’t trust new stores.
      However, people trust the online marketplace that is already established.
      If customers don’t like the product they receive, then they can complain
      about the marketplace. But ordinary stores have trust and credibility
      issues once you made the payment.
